    title: "Finally got all my plants organized!",
    comment: `Just finished putting this together and had to share. Took me about 20 minutes to assemble, which was easier than expected. I love how it fits in this awkward corner by my window - my plants are going to be so happy with all that light. The shelves are sturdy enough for my heavy terracotta pots. Only thing is I got a tiny scratch on the base while moving it into place, but you can barely see it. Already planning what plants to add to the empty spots!`,

    title: "Holds all 14 of my plants!",
    comment: `I was worried this wouldn't hold all my plants but wow, I fit 14 pots on here ranging from small succulents to my big peace lily. The shelves have some water marks now from watering day but that's my fault for not being careful. It's been two months and no wobbling or sagging. My pothos is loving the height and trailing down beautifully. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is I wish the shelves were slightly wider for my one pot that hangs over the edge a bit.`,

    title: "Perfect for my tiny bedroom",
    comment: `My bedroom is maybe 10x10 and I thought there was no way I could have plants in here. This stand changed everything - it takes up like 1 square foot of floor space but I now have 7 plants in my room. I keep it between my nightstand and the corner. Had to put a little cardboard under one leg because my floor is uneven but it's stable now. The warm light from my lamp makes it look really cozy at night. Assembly was straightforward, took maybe 25 min.`,

    title: "Solid build quality for the price",
    comment: `Just finished assembling and wanted to share a close-up of the quality. The shelves are thicker than I expected - feels like real wood not flimsy particle board. The metal frame is sturdy powder-coated steel, you can see the joints are well made. I noticed a tiny bubble in the coating on one leg but it's barely visible. All the screws were included plus a couple extras which was nice. The instructions were clear enough. Overall impressed with the construction, especially compared to cheaper stands I've seen at big box stores.`,

    title: "My plants are so happy by the window",
    comment: `Had to snap a pic this morning - the way the light comes through my kitchen window and hits all the plants is just beautiful. I moved the stand here last week and already notice my plants perking up. You can see in the photo how the light filters through the leaves. My pothos has grown like 3 inches already! The stand is tall enough that even the top shelf gets good light. Only downside is I can see all the dust on the shelves now lol time to clean. Worth every penny though.`,

    title: "Not just for plants - great entryway piece",
    comment: `I didn't want a boring entryway table so I got this instead. I use it for plants AND practical stuff - there's a bowl for keys on one shelf, a little tray for mail, and the rest is plants. It's narrow enough that it doesn't block the hallway in my small apartment. My only complaint is I wish there was one more shelf at hip height for setting things down when I walk in. The droopy plant in the pic needs water, not the stand's fault haha. Great purchase for apartment living.`,

The 7 tiers give me plenty of room, and the metal frame feels incredibly sturdy. Assembly took about 25 minutes with just a Phillips head screwdriver. My living room corner has never looked better!',
